    "This page covers all the object orianted programming concepts in python.\n",
    "Topics:\n",
    "1) Class and instances\n",
    "2) Class variables\n",
    "3) Class methods and Static methods\n",
    "4) Inheritance and creating sub-class\n",
    "5) Special dunder methods\n",
    "6) Property Decorators (Getter, Setter, Deleter)\n",
    "7) Polymorphisum\n",

    "Topic 1: Class and instances\n",
    "    Class is the fundamental unit of abstraction. \n",
    "    Classes allows us to organize and group the data for real world problems.\n",
    "    Data and functions that are associated with class are known as attributes and methods respectively.\n",
    "    Method: it is a function associated with class\n",
    "For example: you want to maintain all the recors for online movie store.\n",
    "Each movie is goind to have data like:\n",
    "                    Movie name\n",
    "                    Release date\n",
    "                    Genre\n",
    "Thus it would be eaisier if we have a class whcich can create a blueprint for a movie and by using instance of the class\n",
    "we can create a new movie every time. \n",
